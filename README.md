# Arxiv Tracker

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Arxiv Tracker is a web application designed to help users keep track of the latest research papers on arXiv.org. It allows users to tag arXiv searches and easily combine different searches.

## Created with GitHub Copilot

This project was created with the assistance of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI-powered code completion tool that helps developers write code faster and with greater accuracy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
